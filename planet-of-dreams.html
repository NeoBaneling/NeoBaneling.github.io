                This digital drawing comes from a personal collection titled
                "Planet of Dreams", and is a stylistic inspiration for Mother, a
                large-scale conceptual universe I have been building. The drawing
                does a great job of expressing shape with minimal color and
                negative space. For example, the existence of the mountain and
                moon exist only because of their fading purple outline and the
                blackness of their bodies, which contrast with the full sky of stars.
            </p>

                The drawing also has an interesting symmetry about it. The top
                two thirds build a natural gradient from light to dark with the
                fading purple, but the final third disrupts this by introducing
                blue and red. This disruption does not break the balance of the
                image, however, because of one blue dot. The light blue star
                among a sky of purple stars keeps the symmetry of the piece intact
                and provides variability to the image, which leads the eye to move
                around rather than become bored.
