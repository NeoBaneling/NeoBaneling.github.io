                        While the message of this piece is quite obvious, I would like to
                        note the choices made in its design to guide the viewer through
                        the image. A face and a hand were deliberately included in the
                        collage to draw people's attention, as these are both symbols which
                        the eye gravitates towards. Bold red was used on particular
                        objects in the design whose purpose is twofold. Firstly, the color
                        accentuates these objects which are particularly harmful for the
                        environment and our ecosystems, making the viewer more aware of
                        their presence and associating them with this agressive color.
                        Secondly, these objects all contain lines and curves that redirect
                        the eye to the center. By highlighting these objects, the eye falls
                        on these lines and curves and follows them back to the silent face.
                    </p>

                        This mixed media photo collage piece was created in Photoshop.
                        Several of the photographs in the piece were shot by myself, and
                        other images were found on the internet with license for reuse
                        with modification.
