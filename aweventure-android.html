            <p>
                This summer I had the opportunity to work with Cedowin Productions
                in building an Android version of their iOS app
                <a href="https://aweventure.com" target="_blank">AweVenture</a>,
                which is a group-based scavenger hunt application geared towards
                family fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given my thorough background in Java and experience with IDEs such
                as IntelliJ, setting foot into the Android Studio developer
                environment was not completely alien, but I had much learning to
                do in mobile development and utilizing Google Firebase. I was
                provided online classes while working on the app which I went
                through quickly, not out of haste but because I greatly enjoyed
                the material and was excited about building mobile apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I got into building Aweventure-Android I discovered there
                was still much learning to do, such as loading videos on a cloud,
                building dynamic RecyclerViews with interactive elements, and
                implementing Maps APIs. Thus, in working on this project I gained
                valuable experience in both mobile app development and extensive
                research.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to developing the mobile app, I was also required to
                create projected timelines for having certain modules of the app
                completed and provide documentation on my progress.
