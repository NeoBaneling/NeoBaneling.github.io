            <h1>Princess Duchess's Excellent Adventure</h1>
            <h2>Team Work Makes The Dream Work</h2>
            <p>
                Princess Duchess's Excellent Adventure is a 3D puzzle/ action
                platformer video game created in Unity that focuses on challenging
                puzzles and unique monster/ world interactions. It is the final
                project for a Video Game Design course, which required groups of
                students to work together to create these final projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                My group faced challenges, as does any, in designing our game
                and collaborating effectively. The group - which consisted of
                four students including myself - was named "Team Work Makes The
                Dream Work", a comedic play on words, but effectively embodied how
                we felt what would require to make our game come to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Princess Duchess's Excellent Adventure was well received by the
                professor and classmates, with praise given to player/world and
                monster/world interaction and the visual style of the game, and
                received the highest grade in the class.

            <h2>Narrative and Visual Design</h2>
            <p>
                The narrative and visual style of PD are designed to reflect the
                style and concepts of children. This gave the game a cute, colorful,
                and fantastic design that adds to enjoyment in gameplay. My
                contributions to this style exist in UI, animations, and level design.

                        Every element of the user interface has been designed purposefully
                        for the childlike visual style. Throughout the different menus is
                        a persistent purple rectangle set on a diagonal, which gives
                        dynamic movement to the visual interface. Icons, including buttons
                        and sliders, and the skybox backdrops have a hand-drawn crayon look
                        to them that match what a child might create. Finally, the font
                        chosen is based on the <i>Captain Underpants</i> children's
                        books, which through familiarity and design imply fun.

                Several of the decorations and interactive elements in the game
                have cute and inviting animations that, while are fairly simple,
                add to the cute and fun nature of the game.

                These animated elements range from simple cacti, flowers, and
                grass to flag checkpoints and collectable llamas, the last of which
                are needed to progress in the game. The cel-shaded levels are
                filled with these interactive and decorative animated objects that
                liven up the forest and mountain.
