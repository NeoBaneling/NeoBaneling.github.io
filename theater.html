            <h1>Midnight Tango</h1>
            <h2>A study in Lighting, Costuming, and Action-Driven Story</h2>

            <p>
                I have written, produced, directed, and edited several short films,
                and with each I dedicated my focus to a particular aspect of
                filmmaking. For Midnight Tango, that was lighting, color, and
                action-fueled storytelling.

                        The protagonist and antagonist of the film have a unique
                        color, and this color is prevalent in their costuming and
                        lighting.

                        Arthur Valentine, the protagonist, is surrounded in blue.
                        His costuming features a blue blazer and blue gels were
                        used to color the lights in his shots. This cool blue tone
                        reflects his smooth, slick character. In contrast, Liz
                        wears a violent red dress and is often lit in a bright
                        red light. This color choice not only represents the
                        previous romance between the protagonist and antagonist,
                        but screams "danger". Its presence represents Arthur
                        falling under Liz's enchantment, especially when it appears
                        in the dancing scene.
