                A bunch of text that serves as an introduction to the portfolio webpage.

                Briefly talk about my background and stuff. Probably reference to
                some project I did that accentuates my skills as a programmer,
                with a <u>link</u> to the page of said project.

                        The design for Shruden, as simple as it may seem, was
                        incredibly well thought out own to the last pixel and
                        well exhibits my design philosophy. The characters of
                        the game can be broken down to blocks of color from which
                        the player can derive meaning; for example, the grumpy
                        red Blarp is easily interpreted as an enemy because of his
                        color. The overall aesthetic of Shruden is reminiscent
                        of old arcade games with the large, pixelated
                        text and brightly colored title, which are designed to grab
                        the eye's attention and pull in the player.
