            <h2>Easy to Learn. Hard to Master.</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of the three primary principles of game design, and
                is something that I am sure to hinge my games on when creating
                them. Shruden is no different. Players grasp the concept and goal
                of the game quickly, but completing it is far more difficult.

                Shruden was a homework assignment for a class titled "Media Device
                Architecture" and focused on the basic hardware elements of a
                computer, and how software interacts with that hardware. All of
                our programming assignments were done in C, and most for the
                Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Because of this, the programs we
                created in the class were extremely limited in memory and graphics.
                I focused on using these limitations to my advantage in the class,
                as I hinged my game design around various retro-style games.

            <p>
                The design for Shruden, as simple as it may seem, was incredibly
                well thought out down to the last pixel and exhibits my
                <a href="design.html">design philosophy</a>. The game menus are
                only built off three main colors - purple, white, and light blue,
                and utilize these colors to create shapes that divide title and
                instruction from navigation.
                The game itself has been compared to Pac-man by others; while
                this was not a conscious effort on my part, I believe the style
                lends the game to that association.

                        The characters of the game can be broken down to blocks
                        of color from which the player can derive meaning; for
                        example, the grumpy red Blarp is easily interpreted as
                        an enemy because of his color. The overall aesthetic of
                        Shruden is reminiscent of old arcade games with the large,
                        pixelated text and brightly colored title, which are
                        designed to grab the eye's attention and pull in the player.
