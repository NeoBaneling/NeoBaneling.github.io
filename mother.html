            <h1>Mother</h1>
            <h2>A culmination of Characters, Events, and Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                Mother represents my creativity, ability, resourcefulness, and diligence.
                It is a large universe several years in the making whose medium and
                story have changed over time, but the characters and style have remained consistent.
                To me, Mother is one of the most important creative and technical
                collaborative efforts I have ever pursued.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother first began as an inspiration that bloomed into a full-length
                feature film screenplay, which I still hope to become a reality
                in the future. I adapted five of the scenes from the screenplay
                and developed a short 30 minute film with my friends and father.
                The screenplay went through a few iterations, focusing on developing
                a cohesive story and making the characters more alive. Then, out
                of necessity for one of my project based classes at Georgia Tech,
                Mother became a platformer video game on the Game Boy Advance.

            <p>
                In its several revisions of development and medium, Mother has
                become more refined and consistent, with a fleshed out, uniform
                <a href="#mother_design">design style deeply rooted in 80s nostalgia and
                science fiction.</a> The design of the universe itself, however,
                is meaningless without the ability to experience it. Through my
                <a href="#mother_skill">skills, versatility, and resourcefulness</a> I
                have been able to deliver multiple means to experience this
                universe across different mediums.

            <p>
                Sometime in March of 2016, I watched Zootopia in theaters. Twice.
                I fell in love with the movie after watching it and developed a
                strong inspiration to write something - anything - but I had no
                clue what to write. The sensation persisted within me for several
                days until eventually on the bus to a band event, both out of
                boredom and annoyance, I opened up a Google Doc on my phone and
                began writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had no clue what I was writing, but it didn't feel as though
                I had something to write; rather, it felt as if I was
                <em>discovering</em> a new universe. As black text carved into
                the white canvas of my phone screen, I was excavating characters,
                events, ideas. There were people I had never heard of yet felt
                like I could relate to, and they were very interesting people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The characters I discovered that day - Avara, Vang, Mussel, and
                Meuford - had such diverse and iconic personalities that fueled
                me. I wanted to know more about these people, learn of their
                backstories and conflicts, but to discover this I had to write.

            <h2 id="mother_skill">Portraying Mother over several mediums</h2>
            <p>
                Mother has been expressed in several different media, from a screenplay
                to a short film to a video game, and with each medium comes its
                own set of challenges and skills required to deliver effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                After writing the first draft of Mother, I delved extensively
                into screenwriting, character development, and story structure to
                make my screenplay the best it can possibly become. I discovered
                <a href="http://www.sethworley.com/homepage" target="_blank">Seth Worley</a>,
                a writer/ director of short films who focuses on character-driven
                comedy and high-concept spectacles. I found his online classes
                <em>Writing 101</em> and <em>Writing 201</em> both humourous and
                inisghtful, and put his teachings to practice. I reworked my story
                on a fundamental level, focusing on only telling the minimum
                viable story and stripping away unnecessary characters and events.
                I developed the ability to analyze my own work and decide what was
                important. In this endeavour I have strengthened my creative writing,
                researching, and critical thinking skills, and have delivered what
                I believe to be a much stronger story than what existed before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I had never directed or edited a live action film of any
                length, adapting Mother to the screen was quite an undertaking.
