            <h1>Mother</h1>
            <h2>A culmination of Characters, Events, and Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                Mother represents my creativity, ability, resourcefulness, and diligence.
                It is a large universe several years in the making whose medium and
                story have changed over time, but the characters and style have remained consistent.
                To me, Mother is one of the most important creative and technical
                collaborative efforts I have ever pursued.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother first began as an inspiration that bloomed into a full-length
                feature film screenplay, which I still hope to become a reality
                in the future. I adapted five of the scenes from the screenplay
                and developed a short 30 minute film with my friends and father.
                The screenplay went through a few iterations, focusing on developing
                a cohesive story and making the characters more alive. Then, out
                of necessity for one of my project based classes at Georgia Tech,
                Mother became a platformer video game on the Game Boy Advance.

            </p>
            <p>
                In its several revisions of development and medium, Mother has
                become more refined and consistent, with a fleshed out, uniform
                <a href="#mother_design">design style deeply rooted in 80s nostalgia and
                science fiction.</a> The design of the universe itself, however,
                is meaningless without the ability to experience it. Through my
                <a href="#mother_skill">skills, versatility, and resourcefulness</a> I
                have been able to deliver multiple means to experience this
                universe across different mediums.
            </p>
            <h2 id="mother_history">A large universe several years in the making</h2>
            <p>
                Sometime in March of 2016, I watched Zootopia in theaters. Twice.
                I fell in love with the movie after watching it and developed a
                strong inspiration to write something - anything - but I had no
                clue what to write. The sensation persisted within me for several
                days until eventually on the bus to a band event, both out of
                boredom and annoyance, I opened up a Google Doc on my phone and
                began writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had no clue what I was writing, but it didn't feel as though
                I had something to write; rather, it felt as if I was
                <em>discovering</em> a new universe. As black text carved into
                the white canvas of my phone screen, I was excavating characters,
                events, ideas. There were people I had never heard of yet felt
                like I could relate to, and they were very interesting people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The characters I discovered that day - Avara, Vang, Mussel, and
                Meuford - had such diverse and iconic personalities that fueled
                me. I wanted to know more about these people, learn of their
                backstories and conflicts, but to discover this I had to write.
            </p>
            <p>
                After about five months of writing, I had developed a 317 page
                screenplay that, while very rough and not well put together, was
                still something I was proud of. Mr. Mark Pierce, my tenth grade
                english teacher whose opinion I admire greatly, graciously read
                the story and provided me with notes and insights. I continued
                with revisions to the screenplay for several months until I got
                a fantastic idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                What if I made a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, attempting to create a full length movie without any
                prior professional experience was nearly out of the question, but
                turning my parents' living room into a makeshift studio for a week
                was quite feasable. I decided to only film five scenes of the
                monstrouls multitude in the screenplay; these scenes were both
                feasable to pull off with a limited budget and drove the story
                of the main characters. The abridged project was aptly titled
                Mother: Select Scenes from the Motion Picture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Filming took place the last week of May in 2017, the day after my
                high scool graduation. The six weeks spent afterwards were filled
                with video editing, poster designing, and coordinating a venue
                for screening the movie. By the end of the laborious period my
                family, friends, and I had a special collaborative project which
                we all coontributed to and brought to life. The cast and crew of
                Mother: Select Scenes had a private screening in July of 2017,
                followed by a one-night public screening in my high school
                auditorium on July 27th, for which over 100 people attended. That
                night was singlehandedly one of the most impactful events of my
                life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then for the following year not very much happened of Mother
                screenwise. I transferred the Google Doc to celtx.com, a professional
                screenwriting tool, reformatting the entire story to match industry
                standards. I would occasionally have periods of inspiration and
                revision, but college had begun and absorbed much of my time. I
                discovered Seth Worley and
                <a href="mother.html#mother_writing">strengthened my writing</a>
                and often attempted to adapt Mother to the glamorized Storyclock
                of Worley's design. The screenplay now rests in its fourth draft,
                which I believe to be much stronger than the first, but still not
                finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother continued to remain fairly untouched until the spring of
                2019, while taking a class at Georgia Tech titled "Media Device
                Architecture". The class focused on the innerworkings of hardware
                and hardware/ software communication, and applied this in the
                context of the Game Boy Advance, which meant that our projects
                were essentially video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than having a final exam or a term paper for the class, each
                student was required to generate a game that implements a set of
                requirements and give a live demo presentation of the game. The
                game could be any design, theme, or style, as long as it followed
                the certain requirements. Thus, I turned to Mother as my inspiration,
                as it was already a well thought out universe with story and
                design that could be implemented and altered to fit into a video
                game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother: The Video Game became a puzzle/ action platformer with
                multiple characters to play, where each character had their own
                level and unique abilities. I blew away my Teaching Assistants
                with the game and scored full marks on the project, fully
                demonstrating my undersanding of the concepts from the course.
                Additionally, though, the project let me rediscover Mother. It
                was no longer the Google Doc where I first learned the names and
                attitudes of the characters I love, but an entire universe which
                I could express and interpret over several media, with each one
                providing more insight into the Culmination of Characters,
                Events, and Ideas.
            </p>
            <h2 id="mother_design">Design</h2>
            <p>
                The design for Mother draws its roots from several different
                artifacts, time periods, and my personal interests that together
                create a truly unique and stunning universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several of the characters and species that exist in Mother can
                be attributed to Zootopia and Gary Larson's <em>The Far Side</em>,
                which provide a large source of absurdity and diversity to the
                universe. There are a plethora of half-human species such as
                agressive Lobster men and tribal Axolotl people in the universe,
                along with sentient animals such as intelligent cows that take
                over a farm and plan global domination utilizing a chicken army.
                On a more tame side, characters are often referred to as a certain
                animal, such as "rat", "pig", or "sheep". If you are familiar
                with either of the previously listed inspirations, I think it is
                clear to see how they have impacted the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another integral component of Mother is the cultural style. Mother
                is a deep-rooted 1980s nostalgia machine with names, costuming,
                scenes, dialogue, posters, and music serving as an homage and
                continuation of the beloved decade. Obviously, for an individual
                who spent six months in the 20th century, integrating this time
                period into the universe was quite the undertaking. I researched
                extensively, listened to hundreds music albums, and analyzed
                several science fiction and culturally impactful movies from the
                time period. While working on the screenplay, I often tried to
                find an explanation for the 1980's prevalance in this universe's
                culture, from a mass exodus to space in 1986 to a worldwide
                appreciation for the decade, but I eventually settled on "do I
                need one?".
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from external entertainment and cultural inspirations,
                Mother is, as all works tend to be of their creators, indicative
                of myself. The universe is composed of my interests, humors, and
                outlook on the world. This includes a planet full of dinosaurs,
                a mysterious gang in an old west town that wears plague doctor
                masks, using "bean bag" as an insult, highlighting the importance
                of adventure, skeleton space police pirates, witty bantering
                between characters, a moon inhabited by giant bugs... And the
                list continues.
            </p>
            <p>
                These different inspirations and interests are quite unique and
                diverse and have come together to build a very different universe.
                I believe it would be quite difficult to quantify or restrict
                Mother's design with numbers or words, as it is just so complex
                and carefully conceived that it lends itself to be out of the box.
                It is an abstract, absurd universe far from what we have ever seen,
                yet elicits emotion, nostalgia, and critical consideration of the
                world we have now.
            </p>
            <h2 id="mother_skill">Portraying Mother over several mediums</h2>
            <p>
                Mother has been expressed in several different media, from a screenplay
                to a short film to a video game, and with each medium comes its
                own set of challenges and skills required to deliver effectively.
            </p>
            <p id="mother_writing">
                After writing the first draft of Mother, I delved extensively
                into screenwriting, character development, and story structure to
                make my screenplay the best it can possibly become. I discovered
                <a href="http://www.sethworley.com/homepage" target="_blank">Seth Worley</a>,
                a writer/ director of short films who focuses on character-driven
                comedy and high-concept spectacles. I found his online classes
                <em>Writing 101</em> and <em>Writing 201</em> both humourous and
                inisghtful, and put his teachings to practice. I reworked my story
                on a fundamental level, focusing on only telling the minimum
                viable story and stripping away unnecessary characters and events.
                I developed the ability to analyze my own work and decide what was
                important. In this endeavour I have strengthened my creative writing,
                researching, and critical thinking skills, and have delivered what
                I believe to be a much stronger story than what existed before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I had never directed or edited a live action film of any
                length, adapting Mother to the screen was quite an undertaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The video game.
