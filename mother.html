            <h1>Mother</h1>
            <h2>A culmination of Characters, Events, and Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                Mother represents my creativity, ability, resourcefulness, and diligence.
                It is a large universe several years in the making whose medium and
                story have changed over time, but the characters and style have remained consistent.
                To me, Mother is one of the most important creative and technical
                collaborative efforts I have ever pursued.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother first began as an inspiration that bloomed into a full-length
                feature film screenplay, which I still hope to become a reality
                in the future. I adapted five of the scenes from the screenplay
                and developed a short 30 minute film with my friends and father.
                The screenplay went through a few iterations, focusing on developing
                a cohesive story and making the characters more alive. Then, out
                of necessity for one of my project based classes at Georgia Tech,
                Mother became a platformer video game on the Game Boy Advance.

            <p>
                In its several revisions of development and medium, Mother has
                become more refined and consistent, with a fleshed out, uniform
                <a href="design">design style deeply rooted in 80s nostalgia and
                science fiction.</a> The design of the universe itself, however,
                is meaningless without the ability to experience it. Through my
                <a href="skill">skills, versatility, and resourcefulness</a> I
                have been able to deliver multiple means to experience this
                universe across different mediums.
