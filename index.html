            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio webpage! Here I showcase a few projects
                that I believe exemplify my skills as a programmer and a designer,
                and provide some interesting insights in the concept and
                development of these projects. I also provide "case studies", or
                projects that have so much depth I have given them their own page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have an extensive breadth and depth in programming, as I am
                very familiar with several languages and can use those languages
                for many applications. I have experience with
                <a href="programming.html/shruden">video game programming</a>,
                data analysis and visualisation,
                <a href="programming.html/aweventure">android app development</a>,
                to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we'll probably talk about my design style more, and most likely
                put a reference to some other project that relates to said design style
                and provide another <u>link</u> to the page of that other project.
