            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio webpage! Here I showcase a few projects
                that I believe exemplify my skills as a programmer and a designer,
                and provide some interesting insights in the concept and
                development of these projects. I also provide "case studies", or
                projects that have so much depth I have given them their own page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have an extensive breadth and depth in programming, as I am
                very familiar with several languages and can use those languages
                for many applications. I have experience with
                <a href="programming.html#shruden">video game programming</a>,
                data analysis and visualisation,
                <a href="programming.html#aweventure">android app development</a>,
                to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
                My design style has been developed over several years of sketches,
                digital art, and films, and can best be expressed as minimalism
                in color, akin to Art Deco. I believe that less is more, and it
                is often best to extrapolate from what is already existing than
                to include something new. A great example of this is an
                <a href="design.html#eclipse">excerpt from my "Planet of Dreams" series</a>
                which features minimal color and negative space to shape a strong
                image.
