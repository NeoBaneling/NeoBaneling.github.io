            <h2>A Portfolio by a student who can code things and make them look good too</h2>

                A bunch of text that serves as an introduction to the portfolio webpage.

                Briefly talk about my background and stuff. Probably reference to
                some project I did that accentuates my skills as a programmer,
                with a <u>link</u> to the page of said project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we'll probably talk about my design style more, and most likely
                put a reference to some other project that relates to said design style
                and provide another <u>link</u> to the page of that other project.
