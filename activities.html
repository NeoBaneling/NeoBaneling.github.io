            <p>
                Throughout my education at Georgia Tech, I have had the opportunity
                to engage in enriching and fulfilling activities. In BeeSnap I
                have been able to grow as a programmer, designer, and leader. Music
                at Georgia Tech has given me a space to grow as a musician and create
                long-lasting memories with friends.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                I am involved in Georgia Tech's Vertically Integrated
                Project program on the team BeeSnap. BeeSnap's focus is on
                collecting big data of bees and other pollinators in urban
                environments such as Atlanta to understand pollination patterns
                and monitor bee health. I am a member of the subteam BeeKeeperGO,
                where we are building a mobile bee farming and image collection
                app using the game engine Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="img/beekeeperGO/garden.png">
                BeeKeeperGO is a mobile application that gamifies data collection
                of pollinators in urban environments. The user takes images of
                bees and flowers and upload them, where they are processed by
                image recognition algorithms to classify the image's subjects.
                The user is then given in-game currency based on the value of the
                image.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can use that currency to build their garden, which is the
                game section of the app. Users can buy different species of
                flowers and bees with the in-game currency and populate the garden.
                Over time, the in-game bees will pollinate the garden's flowers,
                which will earn the user more currency. As the user buys new
                bee and flower species, they will unlock different pages in a
                factbook, which contains detailed information about the bee and
                flower species present in the game.
            </p>
            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                My contributions to BeeKeeperGO are largely quality of life
                improvements, adding elements that increase user enjoyment or
                optimizing segments to create a more robust app.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my first semester with BeeSnap, I researched and fully
                implemented music and sound effects into the app. Prior to this,
                the game contained no music and only a simple click sound effect
                when a button was pressed, and only on some buttons. Feeling that
                a calm folky soundtrack would liven up the garden scene and
                increase user engagement, I explored free music options, researched
                looping music in Unity, and implemented what I set out to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second semester saw me as the team lead for BeeKeeperGO, which
                meant onboarding new members with GitHub and Unity, facilitating
                discussion in meetings, and encouraging members to tackle what
                they want to do with the app. In addition, we also had a deadline
                to release the app by the end of the semester. As a result, the
                semester was largely focused on creating a minimum viable product
                to be released. Unfortunately due to COVID-19, our work was halted
                mid-semester and we weren't able to release BeeKeeperGo, but we
                were able to fix several bugs, implement new features, and polish
                gameplay.

                One of my most active hobbies was music as I was a member of several
                music ensembles at Tech. I played trumpet in the Georgia Tech
                Marching Band and Pep Band, and bass guitar in one of the school's
                jazz ensembles. Additionally, I am a sister of the Epsilon Theta
                chapter of Tau Beta Sigma, a co-ed band service sorority.

            <h2>School Spirit</h2>
            <p>
                I marched with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket Marching Band
                for three years, performing at several sporting events, school
                occasions, and community events. Being part of the band gave me the
                opportunity to connect with people who shared a common interest.
            </p>
            <img src="img/band/trumpets.png">
            <p>
                In the fall of 2019 I joined the marching band's leadership and became
                one of four Libraries Lieutenants. Our duties included creating
                copies of music and drill for members, handling the purchase and
                distribution of music folders and lyres, and replacing music or
                drill when needed. Additionally, the libraries team sought to
                digitally convert our paper music library into a google drive,
                making it easier to find and categorize music. This was a year-long
                process, and included help from other members of the band, including
                the sisters of Tau Beta Sigma and brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi.

                Tau Beta Sigma is a co-ed band service sorority which strives to
                serve the Georgia Tech band and the Atlanta music community. The
                organization hosts several major service projects every year such as teaching
                Girl Scouts about music, cleaning out and organizing rooms in the Couch
                music building, preparing and serving lunch for the GTMB during band
                camp, and traveling to Atlanta schools to teach children how to
                play instruments.
