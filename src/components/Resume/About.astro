				I'm a curious and motivated full-stack engineer with a passion for building accessible,
				performant web experiences.<br /><br />TypeScript and React are my bread and butter, but I
				like exploring different technologies.<br /><br />I have experience building DevOps
				workflows with GitHub Actions and Kubernetes.<br /><br />I earned my undergraduate degree in
				Computational Media and am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science.<br /><br />When Iâ€™m not
				coding, Iâ€™m writing, playing games, or hanging out with my wife and pets.
