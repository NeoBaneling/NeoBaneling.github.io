                        Hello! I am a third year Computational Media major at the
                        Georgia Institue of Technology. Because of my major, I
                        have a diverse field of study spanning from low-level data
                        structures and algorithms to film studies and principles
                        of visual design, and I am passionate about these studies
                        and combining the two to create amazing interactive
                        experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my most active hobbies is music as I am in several
                        of the music ensembles at Tech. I play trumpet in the
                        Georgia Tech Marching Band and Pep Band, and bass guitar
                        in one of the school's jazz ensembles. Additionally, I am
                        a sister of the Epsilon Theta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma,
                        a co-ed band service sorority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am also involved in Georgia Tech's Vertically Integrated
                        Project program on the team BeeSnap, which is about
                        collecting big data of bees in urban environments such as
                        Atlanta. I am a member of the subteam BeeKeeperGO, where
                        we are building a mobile bee farming and image collection
                        app.
