                Since I came to Tech in the fall of 2017, I have gained a thorough
                education in Computer Science. Not only have I learned several
                skills and concepts through my classes, but I have demonstrated
                my knowledge by applying them to a broad range of projects for
                school, work, and recreation.

                This 8-bit video game application was a homework submission that
                demonstrated my abilty for complex graphics calculations and
                established me as a unique thinker that is constantly looking for
                solutions to implement the features I desire.
