            <h2>A Collection of Projects and Collaborations</h2>
            <p>
                Since I came to Tech in the fall of 2017, I have gained a thorough
                education in Computer Science. Not only have I learned several
                skills and concepts through my classes, but I have demonstrated
                my knowledge by applying them to a broad range of projects for
                school, work, and recreation.

            <p>
                This 8-bit video game application was a homework submission that
                demonstrated my abilty for complex graphics calculations and
                established me as a unique thinker that is constantly looking for
                solutions to implement the features I desire.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first glance the graphics might not seem that complicated, but
                every pixel of Shruden is rendered programatically; rather than
                having a set of sprites to cycle through to match the different
                states of the characters, the positions, facial features, and eyes
                are computed and drawn at every frame. Shruden features some other
                programatic complexities. Blarp's direction is always computed
                relative to Blip's position so that the red grump will move until
                his exact center is equal to Blip's exact center.
                Additionally, the green coins are stored via pooling, a concept
                often used in video games for duplicates of the same object or
                character. When building the homework, we had not yet covered this
                concept in lecture, but I continued searching for a means to
                control the coins efficiently until pooling was taught in class.
            </p>
            <p>

                game's planning, concept, and design <a href="shruden.html">here</a>.

            <h2 id="gamblin-for-gold">Gamblin' for Gold</h2>
            <p>
                Gamblin' for Gold is a collaborative group project and
                showcases my ability in back-end development and team-based
                workflow. It was built in
                <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a>,
                 and the background and island images were designed by one of the
                team members.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column large">
                    <img class="center-fit" src="img/gamblin-for-gold.png">

                <div class="column small">
                    <p>
                        My primary contribution to the project was developing
                        back-end data structures and classes that drive the game.
                        Both the bridges and islands are represented in classes
                        that follow common practices such as encapsulation and
                        following the DRY principle. In the island class I
                        implemented an adjacency map that dynamically adds islands
                        that have been connected to a particular island via bridges.
                        Having this dynamic map makes it very simple for real-time
                        lookup to check if it is valid to move from one island to
                        another.

            <p>
                While every member of the team had their own role, the entire group
                contributed to the concept, design, and development of the project.
                Because of this, we met and communicated often to keep the project
                moving forward.

            <h2 id="aweventure">AweVenture-Android</h2>
            <p>
                This summer I had the opportunity to work with Cedowin Productions
                in building an Android version of their iOS app
                <a href="https://aweventure.com" target="_blank">AweVenture</a>,
                which is a group-based scavenger hunt application geared towards
                family fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given my thorough background in Java and experience with IDEs such
                as IntelliJ, setting foot into the Android Studio developer
                environment was not completely alien, but I had much learning to
                do in mobile development and utilizing Google Firebase. I was
                provided online classes while working on the app which I went
                through quickly, not out of haste but because I greatly enjoyed
                the material and was excited about building mobile apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I got into building Aweventure-Android I discovered there
                was still much learning to do, such as loading videos on a cloud,
                building dynamic RecyclerViews with interactive elements, and
                implementing Maps APIs. Thus, in working on this project I gained
                valuable experience in both mobile app development and extensive
                research.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to developing the mobile app, I was also required to
                create projected timelines for having certain modules of the app
                completed and provide documentation on my progress.
