            <p>
                Since becoming a student at Georgia Tech in the fall of 2017, I have gained a thorough
                education in Computer Science. Not only have I learned several
                skills and concepts through my classes, but I have demonstrated
                my knowledge by applying them to a broad range of projects for
                school, work, and recreation.

                        This 8-bit video game application was a homework submission that
                        demonstrated my abilty for complex graphics calculations and
                        established me as a unique thinker that is constantly looking for

                        in building an Android version of their iOS app, AweVenture,
                        which is a group-based scavenger hunt application geared towards
                        family fun.
