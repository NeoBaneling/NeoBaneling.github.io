            <h1>Projects by the Command Line</h1>
            <h2>A collection of Projects and Collaborations</h2>
            <p>
                Since I came to Tech in the fall of 2017, I have gained a thorough
                education in Computer Science. Not only have I learned several
                skills and concepts through my classes, but I have demonstrated
                my knowledge by applying them to a broad range of projects for
                school, work, and recreation.
            </p>
            <h2>Shruden</h2>
            <img class="center-fit" src="img/shruden-play-screen.png">
            <p>
                This 8-bit video game application was a homework submission that
                demonstrated my abilty for complex graphics calculations and
                established me as a unique thinker that is constantly looking for
                solutions to implement the features I desire.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first glance the graphics might not seem that complicated, but
                every pixel of Shruden is rendered programatically; rather than
                having a set of sprites to cycle through to match the different
                states of the characters, the positions, facial features, and eyes
                are computed and drawn at every frame. This computation takes into
                account the direction Blip and Bloop, the blue and pink characters,
                are moving, as well as Blip's position relative to Blarp, the
                grumpy red character.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this constant computation for 24 frames a second, the
                game utilizes double buffering to keep the game smooth and fast.
                In addition to double buffering, Shruden implements a few other
                mechanics that improve gameplay. For example, Blarp's direction is
                always computed relative to Blip's position so that the red grump
                will move until his exact center is equal to Blip's exact center.
                Additionally, the green coins are stored via pooling, a concept
                often used in video games for duplicates of the same object or
                character. When building the homework, we had not yet covered this
                concept in lecture, but I continued searching for a means to
                control the coins efficiently until pooling was taught in class.
            </p>
