            <p>
                Gamblin' for Gold is a collaborative group project and
                showcases my ability in back-end development and team-based
                workflow. It was built in
                <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a>,
                 and the background and island images were designed by one of the
                team members.

                        My primary contribution to the project was developing
                        back-end data structures and classes that drive the game.
                        Both the bridges and islands are represented in classes
                        that follow common practices such as encapsulation and
                        following the DRY principle. In the island class I
                        implemented an adjacency map that dynamically adds islands
                        that have been connected to a particular island via bridges.
                        Having this dynamic map makes it very simple for real-time
                        lookup to check if it is valid to move from one island to
                        another.

            <p>
                While every member of the team had their own role, the entire group
                contributed to the concept, design, and development of the project.
                Because of this, we met and communicated often to keep the project
                moving forward.
