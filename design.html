            <h1>Creative Efforts</h1>
            <h2>On the Verge of a Dream</h2>
            <p>
                One of the earliest drawings I can remember from my youth is a
                colorful Jurassic landscape featuring a Triceratops and Brachiosaurus
                whose skin patterns were designed with the functional intention
                of camouflage. Years later my artistic ability and design style
                have matured greatly. I am comfortable in several media, from
                pencil to digital work to film. My design style is analogous to
                Art Deco, with an emphasis on using color minimally and effectively,
                and a philosophy to "take something known and alter it slightly,
                to the point that it is on the verge of a dream". Below you should
                find several pieces that affirm this design style and demonstrate my
                ability in various media forms.
            </p>
            <h2 id="eclipse">Eclipse</h2>
            <img class="center-fit" src="img/eclipse.png">
            <p>
                This digital drawing comes from a personal collection titled
                "Planet of Dreams", and is a stylistic inspiration for Mother, a
                large-scale conceptual universe I have been building. The drawing
                does a great job of expressing shape with minimal color and
                negative space. For example, the existence of the mountain and
                moon exist only because of their fading purple outline and the
                blackness of their bodies, which contrast with the full sky of stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drawing also has an interesting symmetry about it. The top
                two thirds build a natural gradient from light to dark with the
                fading purple, but the final third disrupts this by introducing
                blue and red. This disruption does not break the balance of the
                image, however, because of one blue dot. The light blue star
                among a sky of purple stars keeps the symmetry of the piece intact
                and provides variability to the image, which leads the eye to move
                around rather than become bored.

                        While the message of this piece is quite obvious, I would like to
                        note the choices made in its design to guide the viewer through
                        the image. A face and a hand were deliberately included in the
                        collage to draw people's attention, as these are both symbols which
                        the eye gravitates towards. Bold red was used on particular
                        objects in the design whose purpose is twofold. Firstly, the color
                        accentuates these objects which are particularly harmful for the
                        environment and our ecosystems, making the viewer more aware of
                        their presence and associating them with this agressive color.
                        Secondly, these objects all contain lines and curves that redirect
                        the eye to the center. By highlighting these objects, the eye falls
                        on these lines and curves and follows them back to the silent face.

                        This mixed media photo collage piece was created in Photoshop.
                        Several of the photographs in the piece were shot by myself, and
                        other images were found on the internet with license for reuse
                        with modification.

            <h2>Midnight Tango</h2>
            <p>
                I have written, produced, directed, and edited several short films,
                and with each I dedicated my focus to a particular aspect of
                filmmaking. For Midnight Tango, that was lighting, color, and
                action-fueled storytelling.

                        The protagonist and antagonist of the film have a unique
                        color, and this color is prevalent in their costuming and
                        lighting.

                        Arthur Valentine, the protagonist, is surrounded in blue.
                        His costuming features a blue blazer and blue gels were
                        used to color the lights in his shots. This cool blue tone
                        reflects his smooth, slick character. In contrast, Liz
                        wears a violent red dress and is often lit in a bright
                        red light. This color choice not only represents the
                        previous romance between the protagonist and antagonist,
                        but screams "danger". Its presence represents Arthur
                        falling under Liz's enchantment, especially when it appears
                        in the dancing scene.
