            <h1>Creative Efforts</h1>
            <h2>On the Verge of a Dream</h2>
            <p>
                One of the earliest drawings I can remember from my youth is a
                colorful Jurassic landscape featuring a Triceratops and Brachiosaurus
                whose skin patterns were designed with the functional intention
                of camouflage. Years later my artistic ability and design style
                have matured greatly. I am comfortable in several media, from
                pencil to digital work to film. My design style is analogous to
                Art Deco, with an emphasis on using color minimally and effectively,
                and a philosophy to "take something known and alter it slightly,
                to the point that it is on the verge of a dream". Below you should
                find several pieces that affirm this design style and demonstrate my
                ability in various media forms.

                        While the message of this piece is quite obvious, the choices
                        made in the design lead the eye through its composition and
                        highlight dangerous components of the image.
